They arrived breathless and panting in the graveyard, where the tombstones seemed to elbow each other outside the shining windows, looking into this cave of",saffron,"light and rosy joy as sardonically as if they knew that those within its shelter would soon be without, shelterless in the storm of death; that those who",82612,82619,Flora

For as yet spring had no flight, no song, but went like a half-fledged bird, hopping tentatively through the undergrowth.

Early next morning Vessons was calling the cows in for milking. He leant over the",lichen-green,"gate contemplatively.

All the colours were so bright that they were grotesque and startling. Above the violently green fields the sky shone like blue glass, and across",328831,328843,Flora
Gone to Earth,"the wood, where the tiny golden tormentil made a carpet and the yellow pimpernel was closing her eager eyes.

Hazel came out on the bare hill-top where gnarled",may-trees,", dropping spent blossom, were pink-tinted as if the colours of the sunsets they had known had run into their whiteness. Hazel sat down on the hilltop and",299477,299486,Flora

In the kitchen-garden also the hens took their ease, banqueting sparely beneath the straggling black",boughs,"of a red-currant grove.

When she came to the graveyard, havoc was there also. Several crosses had fallen, and were smashed; the laburnum-tree, rich with grey",seed-vessels,", lay prone, and in its fall it had carried half the tomb away with it, so that it yawned darkly, but not as a grave from",415545,415557,Flora

The bird sat in preoccupied silence. He was probably thinking of the woods and seeded",dandelions,". He was of the fellowship to which comfort means little and freedom much. So was Hazel.

Chapter 21

Hazel was up early next morning. She could not sleep, and thought she would go down into the valley and look for spring",mushrooms,".

She crept out of the house, still as death, except for Mrs. Marston's soft yet all-pervading snores. Out in the graveyard, where as yet",251879,251888,Flora

To her,",mushrooms,"were as clean as the Lord's Supper, no less mysterious, equally incidental to human needs. In her eyes nothing could be more magical and holy than silken",253685,253694,Flora
Gone to Earth,"perhaps. He ought to wait. But that vow! That foolish, childish vow!

'I could look after her. She could blossom here like a",violet,"in a quiet garden.'

Giving was never too early.

'And I am asking nothing -- not for years. She shall live her own life",112535,112541,Flora
Gone to Earth,"sad cadence suited her emotional tone, and the ideas of loss and exile expressed her vague mistrust of the world. Edward imagined her in her blue-green dress and",violet,"crown playing on a large glass harp in a company of angels.

'Poor child!' he thought. 'Is it mystical longing or a sense of",86564,86570,Flora
Gone to Earth,"gingerly -- tiles being cold to pink feet on a frosty morning -- up and down in the early sun!

Edward so much wanted to keep the",violet,"he had found that he decided he ought to give it to his mother. So he put it on her plate, and looked for a suitable passage to",114407,114413,Flora
Gone to Earth,"imposed on them. He saw, yet noticed nothing, until a long scarlet bar of cloud reminded him of Hazel by its vividness, and he found a",violet,"by the graveyard gate.

'Little Hazel!' he whispered. He pondered on the future, and tried to imagine such an early walk as this with",112149,112155,Flora
Gone to Earth,"I'm not thankful.'

'Mother,' Edward said, when the last unruly guest had disappeared in the wild April night, and Hazel's vivid presence and",violet,"fragrance and young laughter had been taken by the darkness, 'I've asked Hazel Woodus to tea on Wednesday.'

'She is not of your class,",95325,95331,Flora
Gone to Earth,"duck's frost to-night.'

Abel looked up absently, humming the air he intended to play next.

'I bin in the Callow, and I've gotten a",primmyrose,",' continued Hazel, accustomed to his ways, and not discouraged. 'And I got a bit of blackthorn, white as a lady.'

Abel",7261,7271,Flora
Gone to Earth,"have that!' said Reddin, and stopped, having blundered into symbolism, and not knowing where he was. Hazel was silent also, playing with a",foxglove flower,".

'What are you up to?' he asked.

She was glad of something to talk about.

'Look! When you get 'un agen",269361,269376,Flora

She met no one as she ran down the batch, for the chapel-goers were all inside. The hedges were full of",white 'archangel',"and purple vetch. When she came to the beginning of Hunter's Spinney she felt frightened; the woods were so far-reaching, so deep with shadow; the trees",298316,298333,Flora
Gone to Earth,"going to rouse it!'

He smiled again as he always did when breaking horses.

He got up suddenly and went out. Mrs. Marston, administering",raspberry,"cordial in the parlour, heard him knock, and went to the front door.

'Can I help?' he asked in his pleasantest manner. '",245245,245254,Flora

In the kitchen-garden also the hens took their ease, banqueting sparely beneath the straggling black boughs of a",red-currant,"grove.

She went, hand to cheek, and frowning, off the potato patch. But she did not stop dancing. Neither",116609,116615,Flora

'Dunna stomp the",taters,"to jeath, 'Azel!' said he.

'They binna up!' she replied, continuing to dance.

He never wasted words. He continued",116347,116353,Flora

At eleven Martha appeared with",288427,288439,Flora
Gone to Earth,". There was a bowl of double primroses -- red, mauve and white -- on the window-sill, and a card 'with Edward's love.'",Flowers,"in a bedroom were something very new. To her, as to so many poor people, a bedroom was a stuffy place to crawl into at night and",157558,157565,Flora

'Are all these apple-trees yours?' he asked to change the subject.

Only the crudeness of youth was here as yet, and not its triumph -- only the sharp calyx-point, the pricking tip of the",bud,", like spears, and not the paten of the leaf, the chalice of the flower.

For as yet spring had no flight, no song, but",710,713,Flora
Gone to Earth,". 'I wunna be his'n.'

To her, Reddin was a terror and a fascination. She returned to the prickly wreath, sewing on the variegated",holly-leaves,"one by one, with clusters of berries at intervals.

'What good'll it do 'im?' she asked; 'he canna see it.'",66783,66795,Flora

In the summer white lilies haunted it, standing out in the dusk with their demure cajolery, looking, as Hazel said, like ghosses.",Goldenrod,"foamed round the cottage, deeply embowering it, and lavender made a grey mist beside the red quarries of the path.

On Sunday evening, as usual, the little",296888,296897,Flora
Gone to Earth,"the hill she leaned forward, as if straining upwards out of some deep horror.

When their extraordinary turn-out drew up at the gate, Abel boisterously flourishing his",lilac,"-laden whip and shouting elaborate but incomprehensible witticisms, Edward came hastily from the house. His eyes rested on Hazel, and were so vivid, so brimful of tenderness",207752,207757,Flora
Gone to Earth,"out into the lively air, and saw the sun come lingeringly through aery meadows of pale green and primrose. He saw the ice slip from the bright pointed",lilac,"buds, and sheep browsing the frosty grass, and going to and fro in the unreserved way that animals have in the early hours before the restraint of human",111844,111849,Flora

Two laburnums, forked and huge of trunk, fingered the roof with their lower branches and dripped gold on it. The upper branches sprang far into the",202046,202051,Flora

They packed the animals in -- the cat giving ventriloquial mews from her basket, the rabbit in its hutch, the bird in its",206421,206426,Flora
Gone to Earth,"wistful sadness. There are no scents so tearful, so grievous, as the scents of valley-lilies and narcissi clustered ghostly by the dark garden hedge, and white",lilac,", freighted with old dreams, and pansies, faintly reminiscent of mysterious lost ecstasy.

Edward felt these things and was oppressed. A great pity for Hazel and",215033,215038,Flora
Gone to Earth,".

She glanced at Edward through her lashes -- a look that always made him think of the pool above the parsonage, where lucent brown water shone through",rushes,". He saw the look, for he always glanced round as he read, having gathered from his book on elocution that this was correct. He smiled across",234112,234118,Flora
Gone to Earth,".

He was angry and enthralled with Hazel, and the two emotions together were intoxicating.

Hazel was a flower in a gale when she danced, a slim",poplar,"tremulous and swaying in the dawn, a young beech assenting to the wind's will.

Abel watched her with pride. She was turning out a credit to him",184607,184613,Flora
Gone to Earth,"Pool was full of leaf shadows like multitudinous lolling tongues, and the smell of the mud tainted the air -- half sickly, half sweet. The clipped",bushes,"and the twisted chimneys made inky shadows like steeples on the grass, and great trees of roses, beautiful in desolation, dripped with red and white and elbowed",31395,31401,Flora
Gone to Earth,"and mighty power of these exhalations of the soil. Nor did he see that Hazel was enchained by earth, prisoner to it only a little less than the",beech,"and the hyacinth -- bond-serf of the sod.

When Edward and Hazel burst into the parlour, like sunshine into an old garden, they were met by",102098,102103,Flora

Hazel was a flower in a gale when she danced, a slim poplar tremulous and swaying in the dawn, a young",beech,"assenting to the wind's will.

Abel watched her with pride. She was turning out a credit to him, after all. It was astonishing.

'It's",184657,184662,Flora

Silver-crested peewits circled and cried with their melancholy cadences, and a tawny pheasant led out her young",258885,258893,Flora

With tragic dignity he turned to go.

He saw neither Hazel nor Reddin, but only the swan, the",yew-tree,"swan, his creation, now doomed to be for ever unfinished. The generations to come would look upon a beakless swan, and would think he had meant",333989,333997,Flora

He spent the day in a curious manner for a man of his position, under a",yew-tree,", riven of trunk, gigantic, black, commanding Edward's house. He leant against the trunk that had seen so many generations, shadowed so many fox-earths,",223080,223088,Flora
Gone to Earth,"piece of bread and honey that made her dinner, and covering her face with lily pollen.

Now, there were no flowers in the garden; only the",yew-tree,by the gate that hung her waxen blossom along the undersides of the branches. Hazel hated the look of the frozen garden; she had an almost unnaturally intense,15465,15473,Flora

'Sh!' he whispered. 'Say nought! I'll tell you what's a mortal good thing for a dog-fight -- pepper",366891,366899,Flora
Gone to Earth,"had both passed as brides, and down the green slope that led near the quarry to the woods. The swallows had gone. She came to Reddin's black",yew-tree,"at the fringe of the wood, and sat down there, where she could watch the front door. In spite of her bird-like quickness of ear, she",453946,453954,Flora

Her being was more full of echoes than the hearts of those that live further from the soil; and we are all as full of echoes as a,87324,87332,Flora
Gone to Earth,"shall perish.'

But the promising words were obliterated by night.

Next morning, and some time during every subsequent day, Hazel met
Reddin under the dark",yew-tree,".

Hazel had fastened two",foxgloves,"round her head in a wreath, and as she went their deep and darkly spotted bells shook above her, and she walked, like a jester in a",265883,265892,Flora
Gone to Earth,"-- a tiny figure in chaos.

When she came to the graveyard, havoc was there also. Several crosses had fallen, and were smashed; the",laburnum-tree,", rich with grey seed-vessels, lay prone, and in its fall it had carried half the tomb away with it, so that it yawned darkly, but",415515,415528,Flora
Gone to Earth,"What is it, little one?'

'These here!'

'The graves?'

'Ah. They'm so drodsome.'

Edward pointed to a",laburnum-tree,"which had rent a tomb, and now waved above it.

'See,' he said. 'Out of the grave and gate of death --",211222,211235,Flora
Gone to Earth,"; they should be all together in one part of the room.'

'Who'd that be?' Hazel inquired.

'1906, plums; 1908,",gooseberries,"; 1909, cherries, sugarless. The sugared ones are older.' Mrs. Marston spoke so personally that Hazel stared.

'It's mother's exhibits, Hazel",160039,160051,Flora
Gone to Earth,"were first bought. Their rich gilding, which completely covered them outside, was hardly worn at all, nor were the bright birds' feathers and raised pink",flowers,". It would be very pleasant, Mrs. Marston reflected wistfully, to use it again. There were all the bottled fruits, too, and lemon-curd and",135510,135517,Flora
Gone to Earth,"a regalia of flowers, eating the piece of bread and honey that made her dinner, and covering her face with lily pollen.

Now, there were no",flowers,in the garden; only the yew-tree by the gate that hung her waxen blossom along the undersides of the branches. Hazel hated the look of the frozen garden,15433,15440,Flora
Gone to Earth,"out its shining span of days, and still Vessons and Sally were waiting.

Chapter 32

Morning by morning Hazel watched the fuchsia bushes, set with small red",flowers,", purple-cupped, with crimson stamens, sway in beautiful abandon. The great black bees pulled at them like a calf at its mother. Their weight dragged the",390546,390553,Flora

The spring wind, rainy and mournful, came groping",159082,159089,Flora
Gone to Earth,"she had shared in the peculiar beauty of home, the daily sacrament of love. Edward never forgot to kiss them both when he came in; brought them",flowers,"; was always carpentering at surprises for them. These last never turned out very well, his technical skill not keeping pace with his enthusiasm; but Hazel was",317330,317337,Flora
Gone to Earth,"began in its deep and golden voice a low soliloquy recollected as a saint's, rich as a lover's. Reddin stirred disconsolately, trampling the thin leaves and delicate",flowers,"of the sorrel.

At last the door opened, and Edward came out carrying a spade.

Hazel followed. They went round to the side of the house",224132,224139,Flora
Gone to Earth,"to herself. But when she ran into the night to comfort the little fox, she was living up to her faith as few do; when she gathered",flowers,"and lay in the sun, she was dwelling in a mystical atmosphere as vivid as that of the saints; when she recoiled from cruelty, she was trampling",12416,12423,Flora
Gone to Earth,"shadows began to tremble on Hazel's pinafore, which, with its faded blue and its many stains, was transmuted in the vivid light, and looked like the",flowers,"of virgin's pride.

'""The Ash Tree""!' said Abel, who always announced his tunes in this way, as singers do at a choir",117180,117187,Flora
Gone to Earth,"triumph, was flinging itself upon her, she was gone.

She was gone with Foxy into everlasting silence. She would suck no more honey from the rosy",flowers,", nor dance like a leaf in the wind. Abel would sit, these next nights, making a small coffin that would leave him plenty of beehive wood",461695,461702,Flora
Gone to Earth,"like spring musherooms. And I came to see the flowers, and hearken at the birds, and look the nesses.'

'You could have lots of",flowers,"and birds at Undern.'

'There's plenty at the Mountain.'

'Then why did you come here?'

'To be by my lonesome.",262934,262941,Flora
Gone to Earth,"the red roses and the masses of traveller's joy that frothed over it a deep sadness, as if they had blown and dropped long since and were but memoried",flowers,". The shadows of swallows came and went on the white western wall, and smoke stood up blue and straight from Vessons' kitchen fire. She watched the",384367,384374,Flora

He always pretended to be asleep in the morning, so that she should get up first -- shyly",388170,388177,Flora
Gone to Earth,". Summer weather had returned for a fleeting interval. The wild bees were busy again revelling in the late flowers, but taking their pleasure sadly; for the",flowers,"were pale and rain-washed, and the scent and the honey were fled.

'Eh! I wish I could bring 'em all in afore the frosses,",434328,434335,Flora
Gone to Earth,"The moon, riding clear of cloud, flung the shadow of Edward's primroses on the bed -- a large round posy like a Christmas-pudding with outstanding leaves and",flowers,"clearly defined, all very black on the counterpane.

Undern seemed very far off.

'I like this better'n that old dark place, green dress or no",158390,158397,Flora
Gone to Earth,".

The narcissi on the window-sills eyed Hazel in a white silence, and their dewy golden eyes seemed akin to Foxy's and her own. The fragrance of spring",flowers,"filled the place with wistful sadness. There are no scents so tearful, so grievous, as the scents of valley-lilies and narcissi clustered ghostly by the dark garden",214843,214850,Flora
Gone to Earth,", all the while, missus, and the fingers in the tea-caddy the day long! It's Andrew this and Andrew that, and a terrible strong smell of",flowers,"-- enough for a burying.'

* * * * *

Vessons waited eagerly for his opportunity; but Reddin was afraid to leave Hazel alone, in",390191,390198,Flora
Gone to Earth,"on the chapel and parsonage, and a muted happiness. Summer weather had returned for a fleeting interval. The wild bees were busy again revelling in the late",flowers,", but taking their pleasure sadly; for the flowers were pale and rain-washed, and the scent and the honey were fled.

'Eh! I wish I",434278,434285,Flora
Gone to Earth,"preparations, being ready to help Mrs. Marston when she came down, still a good deal upset. Whenever she passed Hazel's room, or saw Edward take",flowers,"there, she said, 'Oh, my dear!' and shook her head sadly. For the kind of life that seemed to be mapped out by",192804,192811,Flora
Gone to Earth,"pride. Its ephemeral petals, pale and bee-haunted, fluttered like banners of some lost, forgotten cause. The garden was hazy with their demure, faintly scented",flowers,", and the voices of the bees came up in a soft roar triumphantly, as the voices of victors returning with hardwon spoil.

Abel had been putting some",115684,115691,Flora
Gone to Earth,short life there had not been many moments of such rose and gold. It was the happiest hour of Edward's life also; for she looked to him as,flowers,"to warm heaven, as winter birds to a fruited tree. As he watched her opening parcel after parcel with frank innocence and little bird-like cries of rapture,",153391,153398,Flora
Gone to Earth,",' he said, 'I'll give you a token till I can get you a ring.'
He picked a spray of the faint pink and blue",flowers,".
'What's its name?' he asked.

'Virgin's pride.'

Edward gave her a quick look. Then he realized that she was as innocent",121784,121791,Flora
Gone to Earth,"wasna. I came to pick the little musherooms as come wi' the warm rain, for there's none like spring musherooms. And I came to see the",flowers,", and hearken at the birds, and look the nesses.'

'You could have lots of flowers and birds at Undern.'

'There's plenty at",262850,262857,Flora
Gone to Earth,"and clear of colour. The sky also was like a pink tulip veined and streaked with purple and saffron. In its depth, like the honey in the",flowers,", it held the low, golden sun. Evening stood tiptoe upon the windy hill-top.

Hazel had eaten quite a quantity of honey, and had made an",264504,264511,Flora
Gone to Earth,"cottage, deeply embowering it, and lavender made a grey mist beside the red quarries of the path. Then Hazel sat like a queen in a regalia of",flowers,", eating the piece of bread and honey that made her dinner, and covering her face with lily pollen.

Now, there were no flowers in the garden",15304,15311,Flora
Gone to Earth,"called throaty, and given a level spoonful of that nauseous compound known as common sense.

Chapter 10

The garden at the Callow was full of old, sad-coloured",flowers,"that had lost all names but the country ones. Chief among them, by reason of its hardihood, was a small plant called virgin's pride. Its ephemeral",115390,115397,Flora
Gone to Earth,"lonesome, riding in a troop of shadows, and sobbing, ""Lost -- lost! Oh, my green garden!"" And they say the brake",flowers,"on the eve of that night, and no bird sings and no star falls.'

'What a pack of nonsense!' murmured Mrs. Marston drowsily",106591,106598,Flora
Gone to Earth,", but went like a half-fledged bird, hopping tentatively through the undergrowth. The bright springing mercury that carpeted the open spaces had only just hung out its pale",flowers,", and honeysuckle leaves were still tongues of green fire. Between the larch boles and under the thickets of honeysuckle and blackberry came a tawny silent form, wearing",1002,1009,Flora
Gone to Earth,"own. The fragrance of spring flowers filled the place with wistful sadness. There are no scents so tearful, so grievous, as the scents of valley-lilies and",narcissi,"clustered ghostly by the dark garden hedge, and white lilac, freighted with old dreams, and pansies, faintly reminiscent of mysterious lost ecstasy.

Edward felt these",214970,214978,Flora
Gone to Earth,"a surprised, admiring glance at Edward, and the service began. It was short and simple, but it gathered an extraordinary pathos as it progressed.

The",narcissi,"on the window-sills eyed Hazel in a white silence, and their dewy golden eyes seemed akin to Foxy's and her own. The fragrance of spring flowers filled the",214697,214705,Flora
Gone to Earth,"herself. She had made so many shawls, and she so felt the cold, that she wore them in layers -- pink, grey, white,",heather,"mixture, and a purple cross-over.

When Martha and the friend who had come to help quarrelled shrilly, she murmured, 'Poor things! putting themselves in",80860,80867,Flora
Gone to Earth,"and adamantine.

She was suddenly panic-stricken; she ran away from the tombs calling
Edward's name.
And Edward came on the instant. His hands were full of",cabbage,"which he had been taking to the rabbit.

'What is it, little one?'

'These here!'

'The graves?'

'Ah",211059,211066,Flora
Gone to Earth,"She wiped her tears away with her sleeve.

'It inna my fault. I'm allus hurting things. I canna set foot in the garden nor cook a",cabbage,but I kill a lot of little pretty flies and things. And when we take honey there's allus bees hurted. I'm bound to go agen you or Ed'ard,189066,189073,Flora
Gone to Earth,"a hypnotic quiet about the place, with no sound of Martha's scrubbing, no smell of cooking. There was always cold meat on Lord's Day, with pickled",cabbage,", that concomitant of mysterious Sabbath blessedness. A subdued excitement prevailed about service-time, and sank again afterwards like a wind in the tree-tops.

Hazel felt very proud",239084,239091,Flora
Gone to Earth,"peaceful, golden day wore on to green evening. It was a day that Hazel always remembered.

When the shadows grew long and dew fell, and the",daisies,"on the graves filled the house with their faint, innocent fragrance, and closed their pink-lined petals for the night, Hazel felt very miserable. This very night",289911,289918,Flora
Gone to Earth,", 'and be my little sister.' Then, to make matters clearer, he added: 'and you shall have a room papered with buttercups and",daisies,"for your very own.'

'Eh! how grand!'

'You'll like that?' His voice was wistful in its eagerness for a denial.",121304,121311,Flora
Gone to Earth,"nothing that stirs passion as spirituality does. She had on a print frock of a neat design reminiscent of old-fashioned china, and she had pinned a posy of",daisies,"on her shoulder.

For one second, as she held up her cheek to be kissed, standing on the threshold of her moonlit room, Edward hesitated.",291509,291516,Flora
Gone to Earth,"the batch.'

And, looking round the room at all the signs of his love, she would suddenly find unbearable the innocent stare of the buttercups and",daisies,"on the walls, and would bury her face, flushed red with fluttering possibilities of unearthly rapture. Then she would sleep and dream that once more Edward stood",430949,430956,Flora
Gone to Earth,"said a word afore,' breathed Hazel. 'Eh! but he likes the
Mountain!'
In the little warm garden with Hazel, among the thick",daisies,", with the mirth of the once desolate ringing in his ears, Edward knew perfect happiness.

He stood looking at Hazel, his eyes dark with love.",225258,225265,Flora
Gone to Earth,"they were. As he did so, a line that had lately appeared on his forehead became very apparent.

In her room upstairs, papered with buttercups and",daisies,"by Edward himself, and scented by a bunch of roses he had given her, Hazel thought about Hunter's Spinney. Edward would not like her to go,",273578,273585,Flora
Gone to Earth,"down whatever you do, and a young fellow -- ' She stopped. She could not even tell a bird about Reddin. She danced among the shut",daisies,", wild as a fairy, and when the sun rose her shadow mocked her with delicate foolery. In her hand, and in that of the shadow,",255303,255310,Flora
Gone to Earth,"Hazel, who already felt an aura of protection about him. 'It'll be so safe -- like when I was little, and was used to pick",daisies,"round grandad.'

Edward knew more definitely than before the relation in which he wished to stand towards Hazel. It was not that of grandad.

Any reply",94551,94558,Flora
Gone to Earth,"It seemed to him that every man in the county must want to marry her.

'What would you say to May, Hazel, early May --",lilac-time,"?'

Evenwood, and go to it together",125803,125813,Flora

The wan,poplars,down the meadow looked accusing. It was almost as if the freemasonry of the green world was up in arms for Hazel. She had its blood in her,325616,325623,Flora
Gone to Earth,"because he was quite indifferent to Reddin's welfare and Reddin to his.

In the kitchen-garden also the hens",31734,31740,Flora

When Edward and Hazel burst into the parlour, like sunshine into an old garden, they were met by a powerful smell",102112,102120,Flora
Gone to Earth,", as a great ideal. With lingering majesty they marched across the sky, first over the parsonage, then over Reddin, laying upon each in turn a",hyacinth,"shadow.

Reddin watched the house indifferently, while Martha went to and fro cleaning the chapel after the wedding.

Then Mrs. Marston came to the front door",223539,223547,Flora
Gone to Earth,"manuscript-book of spells and charms and other gipsy lore -- to her daughter.

Her one request was that she might be buried in the Callow under the yellow",larch,"needles, and not in a churchyard. Abel Woodus did as she asked, and was regarded askance by most of the community for not burying her in Chrissen-ground",3177,3182,Flora

Chapter 25

On Sunday evening, as usual, the little bell began to sound plaintively in the",296922,296929,Flora

She ran downhill into the wood.

Reddin hitched the reins to a tree and followed. He caught her and flung her into the",bracken,", and suddenly it seemed to her that the whole world, the woods, herself, were all Reddin. He was her sky, her cloak. The",305167,305174,Flora

She shuddered at the knife-edge in his voice, and also at the new realization that broke on her that Edward had it in him to be like",421750,421757,Flora

Hazel stood in the window reading the charm.

'On Midsummer Eve, when it wants a little of midnight, spread your smock where the",bracken,"grows. For this is the night of the flowering of the brake, that beareth a blue flower on the stroke of midnight. But it is withered afore",291879,291886,Flora

'I couldna help it, Ed'ard; the signs said go, and then he threw me in the",bracken,".'

Something broke in Edward's mind. The control of a life-time went from him.

'Why didn't I?' he cried. 'Why didn't I",421508,421515,Flora
Gone to Earth,"slowly like the dark blood of creatures beautiful, defeated, dying. She began to climb, holding to the grey, shining boles of mountain ash-trees.

Young men and women converged upon it at the sound of the music, as flies flock to the",osier blossom,". They went in, as the blessed to Paradise. The canvas began to sway and billow in the wind of the dancing. Hazel felt that life was",181283,181296,Flora

Edward felt these things and was oppressed. A great pity for Hazel and her following of forlorn creatures surged over him",215071,215078,Flora
Gone to Earth,"a debt of gratitude for his tolerance of her ways. Ruminative and critical, he went to and fro in the darkly lovely domain, with pig buckets or",ash,"buckets or barrows full of manure.

Hazel, quite intoxicated with excitement, danced between the slender boles till",73313,73323,Flora

Hazel was picking wimberry-flowers from their stalks. She sucked out the drop of honey from each flower like a bee.

Reddin looked round almost apprehensively. Then, as the",270071,270077,Flora

He was angry and enthralled with Hazel, and the two emotions together were intoxicating.

Hazel got up from her chair by the fire and went restlessly, with a rustle as of innumerable autumn",leaves,", to the hall door. She gazed through the glass, and saw the sad feather-flights of snow wandering and hesitating, and finally coming to earth. They",44972,44978,Flora

They went gallantly, if slowly, on through narrow ways, lit on either side by the breath-taking freshness of new hawthorn",leaves,". Primroses, wet and tall, crisply pink of stalk and huge of leaf, eyed them, as Madonnas might, from niches in the isles of grass",147711,147717,Flora

The moon, riding clear of cloud, flung the shadow of Edward's primroses on the bed -- a large round posy like a Christmas-pudding with outstanding",leaves,"and flowers clearly defined, all very black on the counterpane.

Undern seemed very far off.

'I like this better'n that old dark place, green dress",158379,158385,Flora

God's Little Mountain lay shrugged in slumber; the woods crouched like beaten creatures under the night; the small soft",leaves,"hung limply in the frost.

Still Reddin stood there, chilled through and through, brooding upon the house.

Not until dawn, like a knife, gashed",191682,191688,Flora

The may-tree by the gate knew its perfect moment, covered with crystal buds that shone like rain among the bright green",leaves,". From every pear-tree -- full-blossomed, dropping petals -- and from every shell-pink apple-tree came the roar of the bees.

Abel rose very early, for",202330,202336,Flora

They came to the quarry at the mountain; the deserted mounds and chasms looked more desolate than ever in the spring world. Here and there the",leaves,"of a young tree lipped the grey-white steeps, as if wistfully trying to love them, as a child tries to caress a forbidding parent.

They climbed round",74208,74214,Flora

Hazel felt that she would like to go on picking currants for ever, growing more and more like Mrs. Marston every day, and at least becoming",289015,289023,Flora

The sky also was like a pink",tulip,"veined and streaked with purple and saffron. In its depth, like the honey in the flowers, it held the low, golden sun. Evening stood tiptoe",264417,264422,Flora

Edward opened the gate and",117513,117518,Flora

Edward felt these things and was oppressed. A great",215016,215021,Flora

Away at God's Little Mountain Edward preached his sermon on the power of prayer -- how he could plant a",hedge,"of prayer round the beloved to keep them from all harm.

The clock at Alderslea down the valley struck eight in muffled tones. They were burnt into Hazel's",305448,305453,Flora

'Who'd that be?' Hazel inquired.

Hazel felt very proud of Edward in chapel, and a little awed at his bearing and his abstracted air. She came near to loving him on the",lilac-scented,"Sundays when he read those old fragrant love-stories that he had dreaded. His voice was pleasant and deep.

'I hope, Edward,' said Mrs. Marston",78845,78856,Flora

They set out early, for they had a good walk in front of them, and the April sun was hot. Hazel, under the pale green",larch-trees,", in her bright dress, with her crown of tawny hair, seemed to be an incarnation of the secret woods.

Chapter 25

On Sunday evening, as usual, the little bell began to sound plaintively in the soft air which was like a pale",wild-rose,". Mrs. Marston had betaken herself out of her own door into that of the chapel with a good many sighs at the disturbance of her nap, and",297112,297121,Flora

After their twelve o'clock dinner, Abel cut",holly,"for the wreaths, and Hazel began to make them. For the first time home seemed dull. She thought wistfully of the green silk dress and the supper",66055,66060,Flora
Gone to Earth,"that she had sinned against the Mountain so deeply that the old life could never return.

She remembered it as on the night of her wedding -- the",primroses,", red and white and lilac; the soothing smell of the clean sheets, that made her feel religious; the reassuring tick of the wall clock; Mrs",412299,412308,Flora

It seemed particularly reassuring to Hazel as she brushed her long shining coils before the hanging mirror. There was a bowl of double",primroses,"-- red, mauve and white -- on the window-sill, and a card 'with Edward's love.'

The moon, riding clear of cloud, flung the shadow of Edward's",primroses,"on the bed -- a large round posy like a Christmas-pudding with outstanding leaves and flowers clearly defined, all very black on the counterpane.

Undern seemed very",158294,158303,Flora

Hazel had eaten quite a quantity of honey, and had made an appreciable difference in the",wimberry,"yield of half an acre, for she sipped hastily like a honey-fly. She was one of those who are full of impatience and haste through the sunny hours",264680,264688,Flora

Morning by morning Hazel watched the",fuchsia,"bushes, set with small red flowers, purple-cupped, with crimson stamens, sway in beautiful abandon. The great black bees pulled at them like a calf at",390511,390518,Flora

Reddin's presence tore to pieces the things she loved -- delicate",leafy,things -- as if they were tissue-paper and he had walked through it. Her pleasures seemed to mean nothing when he was with her and before his loud,409069,409074,Flora

The uproar was so terrific that Edward and the six righteous men came out to",458056,458064,Flora
Gone to Earth,"with lily pollen.

Now, there were no flowers in the garden; only the yew-tree by the gate that hung her waxen blossom along the undersides of the",branches,". Hazel hated the look of the frozen garden; she had an almost unnaturally intense craving for everything rich, vivid, and vital. She was all these",15542,15550,Flora
Gone to Earth,"the twisted chimneys made inky shadows like steeples on the grass, and great trees of roses, beautiful in desolation, dripped with red and white and elbowed the",guelder roses,"and the elders set with white patens.

Gone to Earth,"things, and not the God-fearing comfort of the Mountain, nor the tarnished grandeur of Undern, were her life. She had so deep a kinship with the",trees,", so intuitive a sympathy with leaf and flower, that it seemed as if the blood in her veins was not slow-moving human blood, but volatile sap.",256217,256222,Flora
Gone to Earth,"down at her. In the large landscape his figure was carved on the sky, slenderly minute; yet it was instinct with forces enough to uproot a thousand",trees,"and become, by virtue of these, the centre of the picture. He looked at his best on horse-back, where his hardness and roughness appeared as necessary",267559,267564,Flora
Gone to Earth,"'

Hazel looked at him pityingly.

'Dunna you know what that is?'

'I'm afraid not.'

'It's fetching the bark off'n the failed",trees,"ready for lugging.'

'Where are the felled trees?'

'Hunter's Spinney.'

'That's close here.'

'Ah.'

Edward was",91680,91685,Flora
Gone to Earth,"a huff.

She also turned away with a sigh of relief, but almost immediately looked back, and watched his retreating figure until it was lost in the",trees,".

Chapter 20

On Lord's Day more than on any other at the mountain Hazel was like a small derelict boat beached on a peaceful shore. There was a",238784,238789,Flora
Gone to Earth,"merely -- Reddin, a person exactly like themselves.

* * * * *

Rain rustled on the window and the wind roared in the elms. The",trees,round Undern Pool stooped and swung in the attitude of mowers. Hazel knew that the Mountain would be even wilder to-night. Yet the Mountain shone in paradisic colours,411447,411452,Flora
Gone to Earth,", all with trouble on 'em. And the place is full of whispering and rustling and voices calling a long way off. And my mam said the",trees,get free that night -- or else folk of the trees -- creeping and struggling out of the boles like a chicken from an egg -- getting,106198,106203,Flora
Gone to Earth,"into silence -- the multitudinous soft noises of a wood, cones falling, twigs snapping, the wind in old driven leaves, the subdued rustle of the",trees,. They passed the place where she had talked with Edward at the bark-stripping. The prostrate larches shone as whitely as her shoulder did through her torn gown.,309195,309200,Flora
Gone to Earth,"of birds, was the far-away noise of a woodman's axe, like the deep scattered barking of hungry hounds. Nothing else stirred under the complex arches of the",trees,"except the sunlight, moving like a ghost.

These thick woods, remote on their ridges, were to the watchful eye rich with a half-revealed secret, to",226425,226430,Flora
Gone to Earth,"All morning, at any spare moment, and after dinner (which he brought in in complete silence, and which was exceedingly unpalatable), he lurked behind",trees,"and crept along hedges, shooting birds. Even Reddin felt awed and could not gather courage to expostulate with him. In and out of the stealthy afternoon shadows",332069,332074,Flora
Gone to Earth,"has the strongest fascination.

So at Undern, whatever had happened there went on still; someone who had been there was there still. The lawns under the",trees,"were mournful with old pain, or with vanished joys more pathetic than pain in their fleeting mimicry of immortality.

It was only at midsummer that the windows were",30695,30700,Flora

She leant against him, silent and passive, as with one arm round her he guided the horse down the difficult path.

A star shone through the",trees,", but it was not a friendly star. It was more like a stare than a tear.

When the rest of them sprang out like an army at",309969,309974,Flora

'I'm afraid not.'

'It's fetching the bark off'n the failed trees ready for lugging.'

'Where are the felled",trees,"?'

'Hunter's Spinney.'

'Ah.'

Edward was deep in thought. The cornet whispered to Hazel:

'",91731,91736,Flora
Gone to Earth,". She had the present -- Reddin -- unless the other woman had robbed her of him also.

She sat down in the heavy shadows of the",trees,"at the far side of Undern Pool. The water looked cold and ghastly even on this golden day. She watched the wagtails strut magisterially, the moorhens with",383688,383693,Flora
Gone to Earth,"over the edges of the borders, and white bush-roses flung their arms high over the porch. All was heavily fragrant, close, muffling the senses. The",trees,"brooded; the house brooded; the hill hung above, deeply recollected; the bats went with a lagging flight. It was like one of those spell-bound places",311140,311145,Flora
Gone to Earth,"hornets built undisturbed, and the thyme and lavender borders had grown into forests and obliterated the path. The cattle drowsed in the meadows, birds in the heavy",trees,"; the golden day-lilies drooped like the daughters of pleasure; the very principle of life seemed to slumber. It was then, when the scent of elder blossom",32205,32210,Flora
Gone to Earth,"Bitterly Hill, where he missed the path. So it was quite dark when he came past Undern Pool, lying black and ghastly in its ring of skeleton",trees,". The foxhound set up a loud baying within. Only one window was lit.

Edward hammered on the knocker, and the sound echoed in the hollow house",359888,359893,Flora
Gone to Earth,"Undern, Andrew, revolved in his own orbit, and was entirely unknown to his master. He cut the yews -- the peacocks and the clipped round",trees,"and the ones like tables -- twice a year. He was creating a swan.

Gone to Earth,"more ridiculous than ever; and when he shook the apples down with a kind of sour humour, as if to say, 'There! that's what you",trees,"get by having apples!' -- at all these times he seemed less an individual than a blind force. For though his personality was strong, that",37981,37986,Flora
Gone to Earth,"elfdom, full of charms and old wizardry, ready to fall inwards at a word, but invincible to all but that word. The hot scent of the",trees,"and the garden mingled with the smell of manure, pigsties, cooking pig-wash and Vessons' 'Tom Moody' tobacco. It made Hazel feel faint --",311487,311492,Flora
Gone to Earth,"covering leaves; soon they would spread their grave blue like a prayer-carpet.

Reddin was startled when he saw Hazel, who had out-distanced Edward, making straight for his hiding-place. She came running between the boles with",228619,228624,Flora
Gone to Earth,"music, all it meant and all it dreamed. This very night she had forgotten to lean out and listen as of old to the soft voices of the",trees,". She had said her prayer, and then she had been so tired, and pains had shot through her, and her back had ached, and she",327932,327937,Flora
Gone to Earth,"into touch with her own life. She envied these glamorous women of the ancient world. They were so tall, so richly clad, dwelling under their golden-fruited",trees,"beneath skies for ever blue. It was all so simple for them. There were no Reddins, no old ladies.

Their stories went smoothly with unravelled thread",239918,239923,Flora
Gone to Earth,"mud tainted the air -- half sickly, half sweet. The clipped bushes and the twisted chimneys made inky shadows like steeples on the grass, and great",trees,"of roses, beautiful in desolation, dripped with red and white and elbowed the guelder roses and the elders set with white patens. Cherries fell in the orchard",31483,31488,Flora

And my mam said the trees get free that night -- or else folk of the,trees,-- creeping and struggling out of the boles like a chicken from an egg -- getting free like lads out of school; and they go after the,106247,106252,Flora

Chapter 12

They went gallantly, if slowly, on through narrow ways, lit on either side by the breath-taking freshness of new",hawthorn,"leaves. Primroses, wet and tall, crisply pink of stalk and huge of leaf, eyed them, as Madonnas might, from niches in the isles of",147702,147710,Flora
Gone to Earth,"and, as usual, after a long spell of listening to their low, changeless music, he rushed in for his harp.

Gone to Earth,"freshness, and music were bound up in her mind with Edward. She thought only of him as she ran up the hill over the minute starry carpet of",mountain bedstraw,".

'Maybe there'll be no flower, and then the charm's broke,' she thought hopefully. 'If the charm's broke, I canna dream, and",295979,295996,Flora
Gone to Earth,"woods were full of pale colour, so delicate and lucent that Beauty seemed a fugitive presence from some other world trapped and panting to be free. The small",patens,"of the beeches shone like green glass, and the pale spired chestnuts were candelabras on either side of the steep path. In the bright breathless glades of larches",96788,96794,Flora

The moon, riding clear of cloud, flung the shadow of Edward's primroses on the bed -- a large round",posy,"like a Christmas-pudding with outstanding leaves and flowers clearly defined, all very black on the counterpane.

Undern seemed very far off.

'I like this better'n that",158332,158336,Flora
Gone to Earth,"atmosphere with him wherever he went, and before his footsteps weakness fled and beauty folded.

The sky blossomed in parterres of roses, frailer and brighter than the",rose,"of the briar, and melted beneath them into lagoons greener and paler than the veins of a young beech-leaf. The fairy hedges were so high, so flushed",257613,257617,Flora
Gone to Earth,"he could not express. When he trudged the muddy paths, 'setting taters' or earthing up; when he scythed the lawn, looking, with a",rose,"in his hat, weirder and more ridiculous than ever; and when he shook the apples down with a kind of sour humour, as if to say,",37825,37829,Flora

His mother, too, would be pleased. She had expostulated gelatinously about 'this marriage which was no marriage.' He would be",196636,196640,Flora
Gone to Earth,", Hazel was as radiant and talked so fast that Edward could do nothing but watch her.

In her short life there had not been many moments of such",rose,"and gold. It was the happiest hour of Edward's life also; for she looked to him as flowers to warm heaven, as winter birds to a fruited",153303,153307,Flora
Gone to Earth,"faults, and so brimming with fascination.

'Oh, God, if I may have her to keep and defend, to glow in my house like a",rose,", I'll ask no more,' he murmured.

The pine-tops bowed in as stately a manner as they had when Hazel cried, 'I'll never be a",109404,109408,Flora
Gone to Earth,"the one link between herself and them.

'Ed'ard's took me to wife,' she thought. The sweetest of vague new ideas stirred in her mind like",leaf-buds,"within the bark of a spring tree. They brought a new expression to her face.

Edward's eyes strayed continually to the bar of dusty sunlight where she sat",240613,240622,Flora
Gone to Earth,"their ease, banqueting sparely beneath the straggling black boughs of a red-currant grove. In the sandstone walls of this garden hornets built undisturbed, and the thyme and",lavender,"borders had grown into forests and obliterated the path. The cattle drowsed in the meadows, birds in the heavy trees; the golden day-lilies drooped like the daughters",32085,32093,Flora
Gone to Earth,"standing out in the dusk with their demure cajolery, looking, as Hazel said, like ghosses. Goldenrod foamed round the cottage, deeply embowering it, and",lavender,"made a grey mist beside the red quarries of the path. Then Hazel sat like a queen in a regalia of flowers, eating the piece of bread and",15197,15205,Flora
Gone to Earth,"east quickened, as if someone had turned up a light there. She opened the window, and in rushed the inexpressible sweetness of dawn. The bush of",syringa,"by the kitchen window swept in its whole fragrance, heady and sensuous. She took long breaths of it, and thought of Reddin's green dress, of the",295016,295023,Flora
Gone to Earth,"coloured by dawn and sunset; then they had a sanguinary aspect, staring into the delicate skyey dramas like blind, bloodshot eyes. Secretly, under the heavy",rhododendron,"leaves and in the furtive sunlight beneath the yew-trees, gnats danced. Their faint motions made the garden stiller; their smallness made it oppressive; their momentary life",31025,31037,Flora
Gone to Earth,"into the blue.

The may-tree by the gate knew its perfect moment, covered with crystal buds that shone like rain among the bright green leaves. From every",pear-tree,"-- full-blossomed, dropping petals -- and from every shell-pink apple-tree came the roar of the bees.

Abel rose very early, for he considered it the",202349,202358,Flora
Gone to Earth,"and her own. The fragrance of spring flowers filled the place with wistful sadness. There are no scents so tearful, so grievous, as the scents of",valley-lilies,"and narcissi clustered ghostly by the dark garden hedge, and white lilac, freighted with old dreams, and pansies, faintly reminiscent of mysterious lost ecstasy.

Edward",214952,214965,Flora

On sunny slopes the hyacinths pushed out close-packed",buds,"between their covering leaves; soon they would spread their grave blue like a prayer-carpet. Hazel, stooping in her old multi-coloured pinafore, her bare arms gleaming like",97071,97075,Flora

It was cold in the Callow -- a spinney of silver birches and larches that topped a round hill. A purple mist hinted of",buds,"in the tree-tops, and a fainter purple haunted the vistas between the silver and brown boles.

Only the crudeness of youth was here as yet, and not",488,492,Flora

The dark shadows lying so still on the dirty white mounds had a stealthy, crouching look, and the large soft leaves of a",plane-tree,"flapped helplessly against the shale with the air of important people who whisper 'Alas!'

The higher the nature, the more its greatness is taken for granted.
Edward turned and went to his room.
Reddin, under his black roof of",pines,", counted the lights, and seeing that there were three, turned homewards with a sigh of relief. But as he went through the fields he remembered how",219313,219318,Flora

Here, in November twilights, when the dumb birds cowered in the dark",pines,", you might hear from the summit a horn blown-very clearly, with tuneful devilry, and a scattered sound of deep barking like the noise of sawing timber,",96360,96365,Flora

Wood-pigeons spoke in their deep voices from the dark",pines,"across the batch a language older than the oldest script of man.

She had no reply for that, and they came in silence to the tormented",may-tree,"where the horse was tied, his black mane and smooth back strown with faded, faintly coloured blossom.

Reddin lifted her on and swung into the saddle.",309662,309670,Flora
Gone to Earth,"laughed gleefully. When she stood by the gate watching for the neighbour's cart that was to take them, she looked as full of white budding promise as the",may-tree,"above her.

'What is it now?' he asked",309294,309301,Flora

Then Edward spoke, and his voice had an edge of masterfulness that",214185,214191,Flora
Gone to Earth,"covert, from the lone hill-tracts behind the house, from garden and orchard, came the wail of the vanquished.

Even as she watched, one of the",elms,"by the pool fell with a grinding crash. Reddin stirred in his sleep and muttered restlessly. She waited, frozen with suspense, until he was quiet again",414508,414512,Flora

* * * * *

Rain rustled on the window and the wind roared in the",elms,. The trees round Undern Pool stooped and swung in the attitude of mowers. Hazel knew that the Mountain would be even wilder to-night. Yet the Mountain shone,411437,411441,Flora
Gone to Earth,"and me waiting outside, pleased as a queen, and hearkening to your voice coming quiet through the window. And picking laylac, evenings, and going after",musherooms,"at the turn of the year. Them days be coming, Ed'ard, inna they? I dunna mind ought if I know they're coming.'

'Yes",435265,435275,Flora

'No, it wasna. I came to pick the little",musherooms,"as come wi' the warm rain, for there's none like spring musherooms. And I came to see the flowers, and hearken at the birds, and",262749,262759,Flora

'No, it wasna. I came to pick the little musherooms as come wi' the warm rain, for there's none like spring",musherooms,". And I came to see the flowers, and hearken at the birds, and look the nesses.'

'You could have lots of flowers and birds",262816,262826,Flora

Chapter 26

Undern was in its June mood.",Pinks,"frothed over the edges of the borders, and white bush-roses flung their arms high over the porch. All was heavily fragrant, close, muffling the senses.",310978,310983,Flora
Gone to Earth,"door and shut it.

After that, for a long time, nothing moved but the slow shadows of the gravestones, shortening with the climbing sun. The",laburnum,"waved softly, and flung its lacy shadow on the grave where the grass was long and daisied.

A wood-pigeon began in its deep and golden voice a low",223849,223857,Flora

He walked fast through the lonely fields where Hazel had passed on her",mushrooming,"morning. The roses that had then been in the bud were falling.

At Alderslea people stared at him as he went by, flushed and hatless.

From",359513,359524,Flora
Gone to Earth,", the traction engine was not in sight, so they sat in the bank and waited, Mrs. Marston regal in the chair; and Hazel held a",buttercup,"under Edward's chin to see if he liked butter.

'Very warm and pleasant,' murmured Mrs. Marston, and dropped into a doze.

Edward listened",143063,143072,Flora
Gone to Earth,"bound to go agen you or Ed'ard, and I canna go agen Ed'ard; he sets store by me, does Ed'ard. You should 'a seen the",primmyroses,"he put in my room last night; I slep' at the parsonage along of us being late.'

Reddin frowned as if in physical pain.

Now, there were no flowers in the garden; only the yew-tree by the gate that hung her waxen",blossom,"along the undersides of the branches. Hazel hated the look of the frozen garden; she had an almost unnaturally intense craving for everything rich, vivid, and",15506,15513,Flora

Gone to Earth,"yellow irises that stood about its marges held a pale radiance, and were like butterflies enchanted into immobility. Huge toadstools, vividly tawny as leopards, clumps of",ladyfern,"not yet their full height and thick with curled fronds, stood proudly on their mossy lawns.

But none of these was the Sign.

He was gone. 'My dear' -- Mrs. Marston spoke triumphantly -- 'didn't I always say that",gooseberry,wine of Susan Waine's recipe was as good as champagne? Now you see I'm right. For Mr. Reddin of Undern -- and a nice pleasant young,250913,250923,Flora

Then they heard Mrs. Marston's slide, and she entered with a large decanter.

She went, hand to cheek, and frowning, off the",potato,"patch. But she did not stop dancing. Neither of them ever let such things as anger, business, or cleanliness interfere with their pleasures. So Hazel",116690,116696,Flora

In the sandstone walls of this garden hornets built undisturbed, and the",thyme,"and lavender borders had grown into forests and obliterated the path.

It was settled that they were to go on the day before the",flower-show,", and Hazel was to stay the night. It would be the last night but one before the wedding.

Meanwhile, the bark-stripping continued, and fate went",139518,139529,Flora

'And suppose we fix it the day after the spring",flower-show,"at

'Well, when you've sung, you can have tea",125896,125907,Flora

And then, round the next",285709,285714,Flora

He picked a spray of the faint pink and blue flowers.
'What's its name?' he asked.

Edward gave her a quick look. Then he realized that she was as innocent as her little fox, and as free from artifice. That was",121827,121841,Flora
